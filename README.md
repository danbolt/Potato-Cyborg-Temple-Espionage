# Potato Cyborg Temple ESPIONAGE

## About
This is a game made over 48 hours on a weekend. I streamed the development of the game live through my employer at the time of writing, [SkyBox Labs](http://skyboxlabs.com/). 

## Plot
You are Lisa Blackout, the most mysterious, brooding, determined agent around. The Colonel's lips are pretty chapped though, so he needs you to sneak into the Potato Cyborg Temple and retrieve some lip balm. Can you sneak past the killer Potato Cyborgs and save the day?

## How to Play
The game is played with the keyboard, and the instructions are onscreen. You can control and play the game with a gamepad too, such as an Xbox 360 Controller, or the [Buffalo Classic USB Gamepad](https://www.amazon.ca/Buffalo-Classic-USB-Gamepad-PC/dp/B002B9XB0E) (which I love).

I've hosted it on my itch.io page [here](https://danbolt.itch.io/ptg-espionage), or you can clone and run the game yourself.

## Requirements
- A modern web browser (such as Safari or Firefox)
- Some sort of local web server (protip: `sudo npm install -g http-server`)

## Running
1. Run a web server pointing at the repo's root directory. Then, open a web browser and point to that server.

## I have a question! Something broke!
Feel free to email me.
